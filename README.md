## The main purpose of this analysis was understanding the differentiation by city type on a weekly based understanding when and which is our target, we just need to compare that information against V. Isualize resource capacity to reach the targetted market. 

#Results
## Based on the graphs we understand that we cand find peaks on the fare on the last two weeks of each month and a decrease on the first. Urban Type of cities have a higher fare vs the rural which are the lowest. This based on the amount of drivers on each type of city. 

#Summary
##We recommend  focusing on Urban Cities, due to high level on income based on fares
##We suggest keep the focus on the last two weeks of the month there is higher income based on fares
##We should take a look into the market share on the rural areas, even it is lower, competence might be lower, and there might be alternate routes we are not lookint into.
